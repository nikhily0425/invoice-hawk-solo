"""
Lambda handler to finalise invoice processing after approval.

Triggered by a Slack interactive callback (e.g. via API Gateway).  The event
payload includes the invoice ID and the userâ€™s decision (approve or
reject).  If approved, the invoice is posted to NetSuite (test mode) via
the sandbox API.  The invoice status and audit log are updated
accordingly.
